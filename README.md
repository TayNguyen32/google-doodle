# My Topic Google Doodle

For this Google doodle, I had decided to pick the theme of Batman. One of the most iconic and well-known superhero figures to ever be portrayed for the world to view. Batman is also widely known as the 'Caped Crusader', the 'World's Greatest Detective', and the 'Dark Knight'. For me personally, I had chosen this as my theme because The Dark Knight Trilogy movies were some of the best superhero movies I have seen. It perfectly balances between action thriller while still maintaining the core parts of what makes Batman aka The Dark Knight such a masterful figure.
